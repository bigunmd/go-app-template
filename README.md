# App [![Mentioned in Awesome Fiber](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge-flat.svg)](https://github.com/gofiber/awesome-fiber)

Golang application template. Based on clean architecture principles
- `internal/domain` - business models and rules
- `internal/app` - "App" applicaiton setup
- `internal/usecase` - business logic implementations through usecase and repository interfaces
- `internal/controller` - controllers implementations that orchestrate various usecases
- `migrations` - application migrations
- `config` - application configuration structs and helpers
- `pkg` - additional, non-dependant infrastructure and logic that can be also used externaly, outside of current project scope
- `cmd` - entrypoints to the applications
- `embed.go` - files and directories that have to be embeded into the applications (migrations for ex.)
- `gen` - autogenerated stubs

## Install Go helpers
### gocritic
Highly extensible Go source code linter providing checks currently missing from other linters.
```bash
go install github.com/go-critic/go-critic/cmd/gocritic@latest
```
### golangci-lint
Fast Go linters runner. It runs linters in parallel, uses caching, supports yaml config, has integrations with all major IDE and has dozens of linters included.
```bash
go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest
```
### gosec
Inspects source code for security problems by scanning the Go AST.
```bash
go install github.com/securego/gosec/v2/cmd/gosec@latest
```
### swag
Swag converts Go annotations to Swagger Documentation 2.0.
```bash
go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest
```
### migrate
Database migrations written in Go. Use as CLI or import as library.
```bash

make migrate.up
```
To reverse migrations
```bash
make migrate.down
```
To force migrations up to a certain version
```bash
make migrate.force VERSION=000003
```
### Application
To test, build and run application
```bash
make run
```
### Docker
To start project within docker network
```bash
make docker.run
```
To stop
```bash
make docker.stop
```
#### Application

```bash
make docker.app.build
```
You can also override build args to access GOPRIVATE repositories inside container
```
GOPRIVATE="" GOPRIVATE_USER="" GOPRIVATE_PAT="" GOPRIVATE_SCHEMA="" make docker.app.build
```
To start application
```bash
make docker.run.app
```
To stop application
```bash
make docker.stop.app
```
#### Postgres
